# Startable backends + backend-listing simplification

**Status:** core shipped in PR #139; Finding A (re-provision the current plugin on managed start) shipped in PR #143.

## Goal

Let devrig offer **not-yet-running managed backends** (IDEs devrig downloaded under
`~/.mcp-steroid/backends/`) as *startable*. `steroid_open_project` can pick one, **start it,
block until the IDE is reachable, then open the project** — without the agent having to run
`devrig backend start` first.

Do this while **simplifying** the backend model: delete the abstract `BackendRow` sealed type,
the dual `BackendInfo`/`ListedBackendInfo` schemas, the `backends[]` array on the list tools,
and the brittle process/pid-file correlation for managed backends.

## Compatibility (waived for this release)

The frozen **additive-only devrig↔mcp-steroid wire contract is explicitly lifted for this change**
(this change only). devrig and the plugin ship and deploy together, so we may **reshape or remove**
DTO fields, marker fields, and tool-response shapes outright — no deprecation/back-compat shims.
This is what allows the full cleanup below (removing `backends[]`, deleting `BackendInfo`/
`ListedBackendInfo`, reshaping the CLI `--json`). `docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` Tenet 5 and the
`ij-plugin/CLAUDE.md` wire-contract section are updated to record this one-release waiver.

## Why the current model is too complex

- `BackendRow` (sealed: `FromMarker` / `FromPort` / `FromManaged`) funnels **three unrelated
  data sources** through one type, then `mergeRows` de-duplicates them with build-number and
  pid heuristics (`normaliseBuildForDedup`, `matchingManagedIds`).
- Two output schemas: rich `BackendInfo` (CLI `--json`) and slim `ListedBackendInfo` (MCP), plus
  a third path (`routing.listedBackends()`).
- Managed-running correlation scans OS processes / pid files
  (`scanRunningManagedProcesses`, `DefaultManagedProcessInspector.isAlive`) — unstable and tricky.
- `backends[]` on `steroid_list_projects` / `steroid_list_windows` mostly duplicates the
  `backend_name` already on each project/window item.

## Core idea — `ideHome` is the identity

A backend is identified by the **IDE install home folder**, not by an opaque managed id.

- The plugin already runs *inside* the IDE, so it self-reports its install location via
  `PathManager.getHomePath()`. We add it to the marker.
- A running managed IDE is matched to its installed copy by **`ideHome` equality** — no process
  scanning, no managed-id round-tripping.
- `backend_name` stays a devrig-generated implementation detail; it is never the cross-process key.

## Three explicit data sources (no `BackendRow`)

Each consumer composes the sources it needs — directly, no sealed union, no merge/dedup pass:

- **S1 — running plugin IDEs**: markers → `DiscoveredIde` (via `DevrigProjectRoutingService`).
  These are *routable* — devrig can drive them.
- **S2 — running non-plugin IDEs**: port scan → `DiscoveredIdeByPort`. **Detect-only**; devrig
  cannot drive or start them. **CLI-only** surface.
- **S3 — startable managed backends**: installed under `~/.mcp-steroid/backends/` (ide info +
  home folder + launcher), **minus** any currently running per `BackendManager`'s pid-file
  liveness (`runningManagedIds`). Only these are startable — other IDEs must be started manually.

## Backend groups — the canonical taxonomy

The three data sources above are *plumbing*; the **user-facing** model `devrig backend` presents is
four groups. This is the authoritative list — the CLI rendering (§6), `open_project` candidates
(§3), and the JSON shape all derive from it.

| # | Group | Source / signal | In `devrig backend`? | `open_project` candidate? |
|---|-------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | **Running, compatible** — can open your project now | S1 marker **with `ideHome`** (current plugin) | yes (group 1) | **yes** |
| 2 | **Running, incompatible** — no plugin / wrong version | S1 marker **without `ideHome`**, or S2 port-scanned IDE | yes (group 2) | no |
| 3 | **Startable fresh** — installed & managed, not running | S3 (`~/.mcp-steroid/backends/`, no live managed pid) | yes (group 3) | **yes** (start re-provisions, then opens) |
| 4 | **Downloadable** — new IDEs we could fetch & start | catalog | **no** — advertised only (footer → `devrig backend download <product>`) | no |

Group-specific contracts:

- **Group 1** is the only set of *running* backends devrig can drive. Compatibility is signalled by
  `DiscoveredIde.ideHome != null` (a current plugin self-reports its install home; an old plugin
  omits the field). See Finding C.
- **Group 2** is display-only — devrig cannot drive or start these. The group exists to *advertise
  the `devrig backend` subcommands* (download/start) so the user can move an incompatible/plugin-less
  IDE toward a usable state. Never an `open_project` candidate.
- **Group 3** backends are started fresh by devrig. `BackendManager.start` re-provisions both
  **vmoptions** and the **current bundled mcp-steroid plugin** on every not-already-running start
  (Finding A implemented). This ensures a backend downloaded by an older devrig boots with the
  current plugin and writes `ideHome` in its marker, making it reachable. Concurrency is safe: the
  marker/port wait in `DevrigBackendService.ensureBackendRunning` plus IntelliJ's own single-instance
  lock (a duplicate spawn exits cleanly) handle races — no lock file needed. Excluded from startable
  while a live managed pid exists (Finding B).
- **Group 4** is never enumerated in the listing — the command only surfaces the install entry point.
  The promotion footer picks the **full-cycle install command** `devrig backend download <product>`,
  which *downloads and installs* the managed backend (per its `--help`); the IDE then appears as a
  group-3 startable and `open_project` launches it. Concrete downloadable IDEs are a catalog concern,
  not a per-run list.

## Changes

### 1. Marker carries `ideHome`

- `PidMarker` gains `val ideHome: String?` — kept nullable only so a marker written by a
  not-yet-upgraded running IDE still decodes (pragmatic robustness, not a compat obligation; the
  additive constraint is waived this release — see Compatibility).
- Plugin `ServerUrlWriter` sets `ideHome = PathManager.getHomePath()` when building the marker.
- devrig `IdePidDiscoveryService` reads it onto a new `DiscoveredIde.ideHome: String?`.

### 2. Startable enumeration + `ensureBackendRunning`

- devrig enumerates S3 by scanning `~/.mcp-steroid/backends/` (reuse the installed-backend
  descriptor read; no `BackendManager.list()` process-state probing for *listing*).
- A service method — `ensureBackendRunning(candidate, timeout, progress): DiscoveredIde` — owns the
  running-vs-startable decision and **blocks until the IDE is reachable**:
  - **running (S1)** → return its `DiscoveredIde` (no-op).
  - **startable (S3)** → launch the IDE at its `ideHome` (`BackendManager.start` does the real
    launcher/vmoptions/spawn work), then **poll discovery (250 ms) until a marker reports that same
    `ideHome`** (homes normalized on both sides), bounded by a timeout, then return that
    `DiscoveredIde`. Progress is reported through the MCP `McpProgressReporter` ("Starting <ide>…",
    "Waiting for <ide> to become reachable…") so the caller sees the IDE coming up.
  - **timeout** (default **5 minutes / 300 s** — cold IDE start + plugin init to first marker) → fail
    with a clear error: *"started <ide> but it did not become reachable within 5m"*.

Candidates are surfaced as a single `List<BackendCandidate>` — a plain descriptor
`{ backendName, displayName (incl. version + build), running: DiscoveredIde?, startable: InstalledBackend? }`
that back-references its source; `ensureBackendRunning` dispatches on whichever back-reference is set
(no sealed wrapper type).

### 3. `open_project` (devrig)

- Candidates = **S1 ∪ S3** (running markers + startable managed). **Not S2.**
- **No `backend_name`**: exactly one candidate ⇒ use it; otherwise return the candidate list
  (running + startable, clearly grouped) and require the agent to call again with a chosen
  `backend_name`. (Drops the `newestOf` auto-pick.)
- **With `backend_name`**: resolve to a candidate, hand it to `ensureBackendRunning(...)`, then
  open the project in the returned `DiscoveredIde`. Unknown id ⇒ self-correcting error listing
  candidates. The command never branches on running-vs-startable — the service does.

### 4. `list_projects` / `list_windows`

- **Drop `backends[]`** from both `ListProjectsResponse` and `ListWindowsResponse`.
- Each `ListedProject` / window / background-task item keeps its `backend_name`.
- This removes `ListedBackendInfo` and the rich `BackendInfo` from these tools.
- **Superseded by #155 (2026-07):** a deliberately slimmer, identity-only `backends[]` was
  re-introduced on both response types — `{backend_name, intellij{name, version, build}}`
  (`BackendRef`/`IntelliJInfo`), NOT the deleted `BackendInfo`. Membership is referenced-only on
  devrig (derived from the routing snapshot); inventory stays in `devrig backend --json` (#151).

### 5. in-IDE (HTTP-MCP) plugin surface

- `list_projects` / `list_windows`: items carry the **self** `backend_name`; no `backends[]`.
- `open_project`: **ignores** `backend_name` (single-IDE surface; there is only this IDE). Matches
  the existing `OpenProjectToolSpec(includeBackendName = false)` registration.
- **Superseded by #155 (2026-07):** the direct surface now always emits a single-element
  identity-only `backends[]` self entry (present even with zero open projects — the identity probe);
  `open_project` still ignores `backend_name`.

### 6. CLI `devrig backend`

Render the four groups (see "Backend groups — the canonical taxonomy") directly from the three
sources — no `BackendRow`:

1. **MCP Steroid backends** (S1, `ideHome != null`) — *you can work here.*
2. **Other IDEs (incompatible or no MCP Steroid)** (S1 `ideHome == null` + S2) — *detected; cannot
   be driven; use the `devrig backend` subcommands to make one usable.*
3. **Installed, not running (startable)** (S3) — *startable; a fresh start re-provisions vmoptions +
   the mcp-steroid plugin.*
4. **footer** — how to download/install more (`devrig backend download …`); group 4 is advertised
   here, never enumerated.

`backend --json` / `project --json` reshape from one `backends[]` (of `BackendInfo`) to the three
explicit groups. **No back-compat shape needed** (no external consumers; output just has to be
valid JSON).

Each backend entry in `--json` output carries a `"compatible": <bool>` field:
- `mcpSteroidBackends` entries: always `"compatible": true` (only S1 markers with `ideHome` reach here).
- `otherIdes` entries: always `"compatible": false` — both incompatible markers (S1, no `ideHome`) and
  port-discovered IDEs (S2) are not driveable and set this field to `false`.

### 7. Deletions

`BackendRow` (sealed) · `BackendInfo` · `ListedBackendInfo` · `mergeRows` + dedup helper
(`matchingManagedIds`) · `BackendInventory`'s merge + process-scan correlation
(`scanRunningManagedProcesses` for *listing*, `isProcessAlive` in the inventory) ·
`collectBackendInfos` · `DevrigProjectRoutingService.newestOf` (auto-pick).

Note: `normaliseBuildForDedup` is **retained** — it is used by Finding B (port dedup in
`BackendCommand` and `BackendProvisionCommand`).

`BackendManager.start` / `download` / `stop` and the descriptor model stay — they do the real
install/launch work behind `ensureBackendRunning` and the CLI `backend download/start/stop`.

## `backend_name` semantics

- Running markers: existing devrig scheme (unchanged).
- Startable: deterministic from `ideHome` so the listing is stable within a session.
- The id a startable backend shows **may differ** from the id it has once running (marker-based).
  That is acceptable — `backend_name` is an implementation detail and `open_project` does
  select→start→open atomically, so the agent never reconciles the two.

## Testing

- **npx-kt unit**:
  - S3 enumeration + S1/S3 `ideHome` correlation (running managed is not double-listed as startable).
  - `ensureBackendRunning`: running ⇒ no-op; startable ⇒ start→wait→return (fake discovery);
    timeout ⇒ clear error.
  - `open_project`: no-arg (one candidate ⇒ use; many ⇒ list+require pick); with-arg ⇒ ensure+open;
    unknown id ⇒ self-correcting error.
  - CLI `backend` rendering of the 3 groups + footer; `--json` 3-group shape.
- **ij-plugin integration**:
  - `PidMarker.ideHome` is populated (`PathManager.getHomePath()`).
  - `/projects` bridge unaffected.
  - list tools no longer emit `backends[]` (later superseded by #155's identity-only re-introduction
    — see §§4–5); in-IDE `open_project` ignores `backend_name`.

## Blast radius / docs to reconcile

Production: `PidMarker`, `ServerUrlWriter`, `IdePidDiscovery`/`DiscoveredIde`,
`DevrigProjectRoutingService`, the devrig list/open handlers, `StubMcpSteroidTools`,
`BackendInventory`/`BackendCommand`/`ProjectCommand`/`BackendInfoMapping`, `ManagedBackend`,
the in-IDE `ListProjectsToolHandlerIJ`/`ListWindowsToolHandlerIJ`/`OpenProjectToolSpec`,
`ListProjectsTool`/`ListWindowsTool` DTOs.

Tests: `McpServerIntegrationTest`, `WirePristinenessTest`, `DevrigToolBridgeClientTest`,
`DevrigListToolHandlersTest`, the `BackendCommand*`/`ProjectCommand*` render tests, routing tests.

### Documentation deliverables (ship with the code)

Agent-facing runtime resources describe live behavior, so they are rewritten **as part of the
implementation** (so docs never lead the deployed binary):

- **`prompts/src/main/prompts/open-project/managing-backends.md`** — rewrite to the simplified
  view: no `backends[]`/`routable` polling; startable backends appear as `open_project` candidates
  and `open_project` starts one and blocks until ready; the CLI `devrig backend …` is for
  installing/managing IDEs, not a prerequisite to open. Remove the managed-preference/auto-pick
  guidance.
- **`docs/guides/AGENT-STEROID-GUIDE.md`** — drop the `backends[]` description from the
  list-tools section; each item carries `backend_name`; backend discovery lives in `open_project`.
- **`docs/PHILOSOPHY.md` Tenet 5** + **`ij-plugin/CLAUDE.md` wire-contract** — refresh stale type
  examples (`BackendInfo`/`ListedBackendInfo` deleted; `backends[]` removed) and record the
  one-release additive-only waiver (see Compatibility above). The Tenet-5 principle itself
  ("devrig-computed output is devrig-owned and free to reshape") is unchanged — it is the
  justification for this cleanup.
- **`docs/devrig-naming.md`** (the backend-naming contract) + **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — reconcile
  any `backends[]` / `BackendInfo` / backend-listing references with the new model.
- Sweep `README.md` / `website/content/docs/*` / other prompt resources for stray `backends[]`
  references and bring them in line.

## Findings B and C implementation notes

### C — compatibility signal: `ideHome` presence

**Compatibility = `DiscoveredIde.ideHome != null`.**

A marker written by a NEW (compatible) plugin carries `ideHome = PathManager.getHomePath()`.
A marker written by an OLD plugin omits `ideHome` (the field was added in this release).

Consequences:
- **Group 1** ("MCP Steroid backends"): only S1 markers with `ideHome != null` (compatible).
- **Group 2** ("Other IDEs (incompatible or no MCP Steroid)"): S1 markers WITH `ideHome == null`
  (old plugin, incompatible) **plus** port-discovered IDEs. These are display-only — they cannot
  be driven and are not `open_project` candidates.
- **`DevrigBackendService.candidates()`**: running IDEs with `ideHome == null` are silently
  excluded. An incompatible running IDE is never offered as an `open_project` target.

### B — no duplicates in group 2

**Port dedup**: a port-discovered IDE whose `normaliseBuildForDedup(buildNumber)` matches any
marker's `normaliseBuildForDedup(ide.build)` is dropped from group 2. This applies to ALL markers
(both compatible and incompatible) — the IDE is already represented by its marker entry.

**Running managed not in startable**: `startableBackends()` accepts a `runningManagedIds: Set<String>`
parameter. Any `InstalledBackend` whose `id` is in this set is excluded. In production, the set
is populated by `backendManager.list().filter { it.state == RUNNING }.map { it.id }.toSet()` — the
BackendManager scans pid files to determine liveness. A managed IDE that is running but has NOT yet
written a marker (e.g. still booting) is therefore correctly excluded from startable before its
marker appears.

### A — plugin path

**Finding A is implemented.** `BackendManager.start` now re-provisions vmoptions AND the current
bundled mcp-steroid plugin on every not-already-running start (see `ManagedBackend.kt`,
`startLocked`). A backend downloaded by an older devrig boots with the current plugin, writes
`ideHome` in its marker, and becomes reachable without a 120 s timeout.

`McpSteroidServerInfo.pluginPath` carries the absolute path of the deployed mcp-steroid plugin
folder inside the IDE's plugin directory. It remains the hook for a future *already-running*
staleness hint: when a running IDE's plugin is outdated, devrig could surface a nudge via
`pluginPath`. No logic reads this field for that purpose yet.
