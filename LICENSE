9.1. Third-Party Analytics Services

The Plugin and its website use third-party analytics services to improve the

event data:

- Plugin version;
- Anonymous project identifier (random UUID, not the project name); and
- exec_code call events (success/error).

No personally identifiable information is collected by this analytics feature.
You may opt out of Plugin analytics by disabling the
`mcp.steroid.analytics.enabled` registry key in the IDE.

(b) Cloudflare Web Analytics (https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/).
The Plugin website at https://mcp-steroid.jonnyzzz.com uses Cloudflare Web
Analytics for privacy-first website traffic measurement. Cloudflare Web
Analytics does not use client-side state (such as cookies) and does not
track individuals across sites.
